# Battleship Game

[ðŸ‘‰ Live Demo](https://samuelferfort.github.io/battleship/)

This project is a JavaScript implementation of the classic Battleship game. It demonstrates key programming patterns and concepts using vanilla JavaScript and CSS.

## Key Patterns and Concepts

- **Modules**: The game logic is organized into separate modules for clarity and maintainability.
- **Classes**: Utilizes classes to create ships, game boards, and players, encapsulating related data and behavior.
- **Game Flow Control**: A central game controller manages the flow of the game, including player turns and interactions.
- **DOM Manipulation**: The user interface is handled by manipulating the DOM directly with JavaScript.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: Core game logic and interaction.
- **CSS**: Basic styling for the game board and interface.

## Learning Outcomes

- Structured code into modular components for better organization.
- Encapsulated functionality  enhancing code reusability and readability.
- Gained experience in DOM manipulation to create interactive web applications.
- Implemented a simple game loop and state management for a turn-based game.

This project is a practical exercise in applying JavaScript patterns and techniques to build a functional and interactive web-based game.
